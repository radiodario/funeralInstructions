Instructions for my funeral - v0.0.1
======================================

## Ceremony
They say the ceremony is for families and friends, but I want mine to be for me. This might mean offending some people. Please blame it on me and continue to have a good time.

### Venue
The ceremony shall take place in a church, preferably one reconverted into a club, so that bar/food facilities are available for the guests.
#### Drinks
Please ensure that _at least_ the following drinks are available in sufficient quantities:
* One good Ale
* One good Lager
* One good White Wine (preferably Albariño)
* One good Red Wine (I'd say Ribera de Duero, if possible)
* Gin, Whisky and Vodka (from local breweries if possible)
* Malibu and Pineaple.
* Ice.

#### Food
Food should be available in sharing tables, and guests are encouraged to bring their own food. There should be sandwiches available, as well as normal things such as crisps and burgers. A barbequeue would be a great idea, but please ensure vegan options are available.
Vegetarians should be denied any kind of food, and thrown out of the party.

#### Body Display and Location
My body should be on display at exactly at the following position in the room:

    let w be the width of the room. (i.e. the long side)
    let h be the height of the room. (i.e. the short side of the room, not the height proper)
    let φ be the golden ratio.
    let x be the position of the body along the width of the room
    let y be the position of the body along the height of the room

    x = h * φ
    y = h * φ
If something is in the way of that spot, feel free to slice the body/coffin accross so as to make way for the column, decoration, corner, etc.

### Music
As a music lover and afficionado, I have very specific (and yet very loosely enforceable) instructions for all the music 

#### Ambience Music and Reception
Light music should be played during the social time, to allow guests to be at ease. I have an extensive record collection, so why not getting DJ KFO or 8GB, if they're still alive, and making them play the records one after another in a nice and pleasing way. Extra points goes for B2B performances.

#### Live Performances
I would like any and all of the following artists to be contacted to play a live performance - of any kind - at my ceremony. Please __do not offer money__ for them to play. They may only play if they agree to do so for free (and obviously, if they're still alive):
* Simian Mobile Disco
* Interpol
* Meneo
* Knife City
* Joe Crepúsculo
* King Krule
* Patrick Wolf
* Navigator (Sabrepulse + Shirobon)
* Dan Deacon
* Good as Gold Trio
* Burial
* Lady Gaga
* The Breeders
* Hatebreed / Slayer

If, at the time of reading this, you think you know someone that might want to play at my funeral, please invite them to do so.
