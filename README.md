Instructions for my funeral - v0.0.1
======================================

## Ceremony
They say the ceremony is for families and friends, but I want mine to be for me. 
### Venue
The ceremony shall take place in a church, preferably one reconverted into a club, so that bar/food facilities are available for the guests.
My body should be on display at exactly at the following position in the room:

    let w be the width of the room. (i.e. the long side)
    let h be the height of the room. (i.e. the short side of the room, not the height proper)
    let φ be the golden ratio.
    let x be the position of the body along the width of the room
    let y be the position of the body along the height of the room

    x = h * φ
    y = h * φ
If something is in the way of that spot, feel free to slice the body/coffin accross so as to make way for the column, decoration, corner, etc.
### Music
#### Ambience Music and Reception
Light music should be played during the social time, to allow guests to be at ease. I have an extensive record collection, so why not getting DJ KFO, if he's still alive, and making him play the records one after another in a nice and pleasing way.
#### Live Performances
I would like any and all of the following artists to be contacted to play a live performance - of any kind - at my ceremony. Please _do not offer money_ for them to play. They may only play if they agree to do so for free (and obviously, if they're still alive):
* Simian Mobile Disco
* Interpol
* Meneo
* Knife City
* Joe Crepúsculo
* King Krule
* Patrick Wolf
* Navigator (Sabrepulse + Shirobon)
* Dan Deacon
If, at the time of reading this, you think you know someone that might want to play at my funeral, please invite them to do so.
